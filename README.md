# Desired Logo Generator

## Description 
---

Designing a logo could be a daunting task. This application helps to realize a simple logo using different colors and geometrical shapes in which you can also add a text up to three characters. The shape could be circle, square, or triangle and the color of text and shape can be chosen as desired. The format of the file is SVG.

<br>

In order to achieve this goal, I took the following steps:

<br>

1. ask the user about the desired text

2. validate text which should have at least one character and maximum 3 characters, and prompt user if it is not

3. ask the user about the color of the text

5. ask the user select a shape from the list of "Circle", "Square", and "Triangle" 

6. ask the user about the desired color for chosen shape

7. check if the color of text and shape are valid or not, and prompt user if they are not

8. make a logo with the format of SVG as the user has asked for

9. write some test to check the code
